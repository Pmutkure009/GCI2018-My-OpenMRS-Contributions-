Hey guys, I proposed this Archive Page Implementation in the OpenMRS GCI Site.

The implementation of this page is quite unique and different, instead of displaying all the data at once, I have decided to Add a field which will ask for the contest year.

Then Display the data only for that particular year, instead of displaying all data at once, which would create a mess.

I hope you will like it, watch the demo video to get a clear idea of it.
